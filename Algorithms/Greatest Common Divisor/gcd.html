            <h2 style="color: rgb(17, 87, 152);">Mathematical Definition</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">
            <p>
                Your mathematical description is accurate, but we can provide a more comprehensive mathematical
                explanation of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):

                In mathematical terms, the GCD of two or more integers, denoted as GCD(a, b), represents the largest
                positive integer that divides both a and b without any remainder. This fundamental concept can be
                defined formally as:
                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>GCD(a, b) = max(d), where d is a positive integer, and d divides both a and b.</strong>

                <br>
                <br>
                This definition encapsulates the essence of the GCD, illustrating that it is not only the greatest
                common divisor of two numbers but also the largest positive integer that is a common factor of both
                integers. The GCD serves as a cornerstone in number theory and mathematics, finding applications in
                diverse fields where the precise division of integers is essential.

            <h2 style="color: rgb(17, 87, 152);">Euclidean Algorithm</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">The Euclidean Algorithm is a time-tested and efficient method to compute
                the
                GCD of two integers. It is based on the observation that the GCD of two numbers remains the same if the
                larger number is replaced by the difference between the larger and smaller numbers. The algorithm
                iteratively applies this principle until the two numbers become equal, at which point the GCD is found.
                This method is both simple and highly efficient, making it a fundamental tool in number theory and
                computer science.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);"><strong>Euclidean Algorithm Steps:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">Given two numbers, a and b, where a ≥ b, set a as the larger number
                    and b as
                    the smaller number.</li>
                <li style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">Calculate the remainder of the division a ÷ b.</li>
                <li style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">Replace a with b and b with the remainder obtained in the previous
                    step.</li>
                <li style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">Repeat steps 2 and 3 until b becomes zero.</li>
                <li style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">The GCD is the non-zero value of a when b becomes zero.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">The Euclidean Algorithm provides an elegant and efficient solution for
                computing the GCD, making it a cornerstone of number theory and mathematical problem-solving. It is
                widely
                used in various computational applications and serves as a fundamental building block for more complex
                algorithms.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(17, 87, 152);">Naive Algorithm (Simple Division Method)</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">The naive algorithm for calculating the GCD is a straightforward method
                often introduced to beginners in mathematics. This simple division method, although less efficient than
                the Euclidean Algorithm, provides a foundational understanding of how the GCD can be determined.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);"><strong>Initial Values:</strong> To find the GCD of two integers, a and
                b, using the naive algorithm, we begin by listing all the divisors of both numbers.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);"><strong>Common Divisors:</strong> We then identify the common divisors,
                which are the integers that can evenly divide both a and b without leaving a remainder.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);"><strong>Largest Common Divisor:</strong> From the list of common
                divisors, we select the largest one, which is the GCD of a and b.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(44, 20, 43);">The naive algorithm is a helpful teaching tool, as it illustrates the
                concept of the GCD and the process of determining common divisors. However, it's worth noting that this
                method can be inefficient for large numbers, as it involves checking numerous divisors. Nevertheless, it
                serves as a fundamental building block in understanding more advanced algorithms and mathematical
                concepts.</p>
