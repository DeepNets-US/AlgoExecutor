            <p>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent
                elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until
                no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. Bubble Sort is easy to understand and
                implement, but it is not efficient for sorting large lists when compared to more advanced algorithms
                such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Algorithm Description</h2>
            <p>The Bubble Sort algorithm works as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start at the beginning of the array.</li>
                <li>Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the
                    second, swap them.</li>
                <li>Move to the next pair of elements and repeat step 2. Continue this
                    process until you reach the end of the array.</li>
                <li>After the first pass, the largest element will have "bubbled" to the end
                    of the array.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 1-4 for the remaining elements, excluding the last one that
                    is already sorted.</li>
                <li>Continue to make passes through the array until no swaps are needed.
                    This
                    indicates that the array is sorted.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Bubble Sort is a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm, and it is mainly used for educational
                purposes to introduce students to the concept of sorting algorithms.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Historical Significance of Bubble Sort</h2>
            <p>Bubble Sort is one of the earliest and simplest sorting algorithms. It was first described by John
                B. Johnson in 1940 and then reinvented by Donald Shell in 1956, who introduced the idea of
                diminishing
                increment sorting. The algorithm gained historical significance as one of the first sorting
                algorithms
                ever proposed and served as a basis for more efficient sorting methods that followed.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
            <p>While Bubble Sort is not used in practice for large datasets due to its inefficiency, it is still
                employed in certain situations:</p>
            <p><strong>Educational Purposes:</strong> Bubble Sort is often used in computer science and programming
                courses to teach students about sorting algorithms and their basic principles.</p>
            <p><strong>Small Datasets:</strong> It can be useful for sorting small datasets or lists where
                simplicity
                and ease of implementation are more important than speed.</p>
            <p><strong>Algorithm Analysis:</strong> Bubble Sort is used for algorithm analysis and benchmarking,
                providing a reference point for comparing the efficiency of other sorting algorithms.</p>

            <hr>
            <h2>Efficiency and Big O Notation</h2>
            <p>The efficiency of the Bubble Sort algorithm is a topic of interest in algorithm analysis. Bubble Sort has
                a simple and straightforward implementation but is not considered efficient for large datasets. Its
                performance is characterized by the Big O notation.</p>
            <p>The Big O notation, denoted as O(n^2), represents the upper bound of the worst-case time complexity for
                Bubble Sort. In other words, in the worst-case scenario, Bubble Sort needs to make approximately n^2
                comparisons and swaps, where n is the number of elements in the array. This quadratic time complexity
                implies that Bubble Sort becomes significantly slower as the size of the dataset grows.</p>
            <p>While Bubble Sort is suitable for educational purposes and small datasets, it is generally outperformed
                by more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort (O(n log n)) and Merge Sort (O(n log n)) for larger
                datasets. As a result, it is not commonly used in real-world applications for sorting large amounts of
                data.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>History of Bubble Sort</h2>
            <p>Bubble Sort is one of the simplest and earliest sorting algorithms, with a history dating back to 1940.
                It was
                first described by John B. Johnson, and later reinvented by Donald Shell in 1956, who introduced the
                idea of
                diminishing increment sorting. Bubble Sort's historical significance lies in being one of the first
                sorting
                algorithms ever proposed, laying the foundation for more efficient sorting methods that followed.</p>
            <p>While Bubble Sort is not widely used for sorting large datasets due to its inefficiency, it remains an
                educational tool. It is commonly used in computer science and programming courses to introduce students
                to the
                concepts of sorting algorithms and their basic principles. Bubble Sort's simplicity and ease of
                understanding
                have made it a reference point for comparing the efficiency of other sorting algorithms in algorithm
                analysis and
                benchmarking.</p>
            <p>Although not practical for large-scale sorting tasks, Bubble Sort played a pivotal role in the history of
                sorting algorithms and continues to be a valuable teaching tool for understanding the fundamental
                concepts of
                sorting.</p>
