            <p>The Least Common Multiple (LCM), alternatively known as the least common
                multiple, is a vital concept in number theory and mathematics. It represents the smallest positive
                integer that is evenly divisible by two or more numbers. The LCM plays a central role in various
                mathematical algorithms and real-world applications, where it is essential for simplifying fractions,
                solving modular arithmetic problems, and optimizing computational tasks. This concept is foundational
                to mathematics, with practical utility spanning diverse fields.</p>

            <h2 style="color: darkorange;">Mathematical Definition</h2>
            <p>
            <p>
                The mathematical definition of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) is fundamental to understanding its role
                in number theory and mathematics:

                In mathematical terms, the LCM of two or more integers, denoted as LCM(a, b), represents the smallest
                positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. This concept can be formally defined as:

                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>LCM(a, b) = min(m), where m is a positive integer, and m is divisible by both a and b.</strong>

                <br>
                <br>
                This definition encapsulates the essence of the LCM, illustrating that it is not only the least common
                multiple of two numbers but also the smallest positive integer that can be evenly divided by both
                integers. The LCM is a cornerstone of number theory and mathematics, finding applications in diverse
                fields where precise division of integers is essential.

            <h2 style="color: darkorange;">New Algorithm for Calculating the LCM</h2>
            <p>The new algorithm for calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) is a
                highly efficient method that simplifies the process of finding the LCM of two integers. This algorithm
                builds on the Euclidean Algorithm for the Greatest Common Divisor and extends it to calculate the LCM.
            </p>
            <p><strong>New Algorithm Steps:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li style="color: darkgreen;">Given two numbers, a and b, where a â‰¥ b, set a as the larger number
                    and b as
                    the smaller number.</li>
                <li style="color: darkgreen;">Calculate the GCD of a and b using the Euclidean Algorithm.</li>
                <li style="color: darkgreen;">The LCM of a and b is given by:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)</strong>
                </li>
                <li style="color: darkgreen;">The result is the LCM of the given integers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This new algorithm leverages the efficiency of the GCD calculation using
                the Euclidean Algorithm and provides a straightforward method to obtain the LCM. It is widely used in
                mathematical applications and computational tasks, simplifying the determination of the least common
                multiple.</p>
